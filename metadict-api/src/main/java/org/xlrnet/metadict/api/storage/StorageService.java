 * attributes of the objects will be (de-)serialized. Namespaces can be used for separating different types of data.
 * <p>
 * When connecting to an external storage service, the stored data will be available globally for each connected client.
 * This may be helpful for implementing persistent data storage across multiple Metadict instances.
 * <p>
 * Note, that this interface is only for accessing the storage. You have to implement {@link StorageEngine} interface,
