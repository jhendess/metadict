 * The interface {@link AutoTestCase} provides a convenient way to model user-defined test cases. A test case may be
 * used to test if the called search backend is still working as expected.
 * <p>
 * Auto test cases support both monolingual and bilingual queries. If a monolingual query should be executed both
 * {@link
 * #getMonolingualTargetLanguage()} and {@link #getExpectedMonolingualResults()} may not return empty Optionals. If a
 * bilingual query should be executed {@link
 * #getBilingualTargetDictionary()} and {@link #getExpectedBilingualResults()} ()} may not return empty Optionals.
 * <p>
 * The core may query the {@link SearchEngine} that is provided by the {@link SearchEngineProvider} where this test case is
 * attached. Upon doing so, the core will call {@link SearchEngine#executeMonolingualQuery(String, Language)} if
 * monolingual test case data is available and {@link SearchEngine#executeBilingualQuery(String, Language, Language,
 * boolean)} if bilingual test case data is available. The execute-methods will be called with derived parameters from
 * {@link #getTestQueryString()} and {@link #getBilingualTargetDictionary()} or the according {@link
 * #getMonolingualTargetLanguage()}. The returned query result will then be compared to the returned values from
 * respective method with the expected results.
