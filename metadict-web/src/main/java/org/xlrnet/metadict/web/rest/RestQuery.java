 * REST service for sending a query to the Metadict core.

 * <li>Two-way dictionary query: call /api/query/DICTIONARIES/{REQUEST} where DICTIONARIES is the list of
 * dictionary languages that should be queried and REQUEST is the concrete query string that should be sent to
 * metadict.
 * This method invokes an automatic two-way query on the core and tries to resolve the internal dictionaries with this
 * preference. This is usually the preferred way for querying.</li>
 * <li>One-way dictionary query: call /api/uniquery/DICTIONARIES/{REQUEST} where DICTIONARIES is the list of
 * dictionary languages that should be queried and REQUEST is the concrete query string that should be sent to
 * metadict.
 * This method invokes the query exactly with the provided dictionaries. Use this method if you want to search only in
 * one direction.</li>
