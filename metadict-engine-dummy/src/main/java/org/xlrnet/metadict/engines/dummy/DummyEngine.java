     * The main method for querying a {@link SearchEngine}. This method will be called by the metadict core on incoming
     * search queries. The core will always try to parallelize the query as much as possible according to the specified
     * supported dictionaries of this engine.
     * <p>
     * Upon calling, the core will make sure that the language parameters of this method correspond exactly to a
     * supported {@link BilingualDictionary} as described in the engine's {@link
     * FeatureSet}. However, an engine may also return results from a different
     * language. In this case, the core component will decide it the supplied results are useful.
     * <p>
     * Example:
     * If the engine says it supports a one-way german-english dictionary, this method will be called with the language
     * parameters inputLanguage=GERMAN, outputLanguage=ENGLISH and allowBothWay=false.
     * However, it the engine supports a bidirectional german-english dictionary, this method will be called with the
     * language parameters inputLanguage=GERMAN, outputLanguage=ENGLISH and allowBothWay=true.
     *
     * @param queryInput
     *         The query string i.e. word that should be looked up.
     * @param inputLanguage
     *         The input language of the query. This language must be specified as a dictionary's input language of
     *         this engine.
     * @param outputLanguage
     *         The expected output language of the query. This language must be specified as the output language of the
     *         same dictionary to which the given inputLanguage belongs.
     * @param allowBothWay
     *         True, if the engine may search in both directions. I.e. the queryInput can also be seen as the
     *         outputLanguage. The core will set this flag only if the engine declared a dictionary with matching input
     *         and output language. Otherwise the will be called for each direction separately.
     * @return The results from the search query. You can use an instance of {@link EngineQueryResultBuilder}
     * to build this result list.
