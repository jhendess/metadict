# This file contains the configuration for the default storage backend in metadict. Upon booting, metadict will       #
# search for StorageServiceProvider implementations and register all available implementations in the                 #
# StorageServiceFactory. When multiple implementations with the same name have been found, the boot process will      #
# abort. The default storage service can be set through the storage.default variable. To configure additional aspects #
# of the used storage backend use variables in the form of storage.[BACKEND_NAME].[CONFIG_OPTION].                    #
#                                                                                                                     #
# Example:                                                                                                            #
#  The host for the elasticsearch backend could be configured by setting the storage.elasticsearch.host property.     #
#                                                                                                                     #
# In case you don't need any persistent storage, the "inmemory" backend can be used. Metadict will refuse to boot     #
# when no storage is configured.                                                                                      #
